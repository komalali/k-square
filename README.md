## Project Boilerplate
One of the most frustrating aspects of modern web development is merely getting started. There are a lot of decisions that one must make before the project can even begin, and this issue is so prevalent it even has its own name (Javascript fatigue!). 

In this repo I'm aiming to create a bare-bones outline of how I start a project, and I will walk through the reasoning behind what everything is and why it is necessary.

**Technologies we will use:**

- Node.js: A Javascript runtime (a way to run JavaScript that isn’t limited to your browser).
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm): Used to stand for node package manager but now it doesn’t stand for anything. It’s essentially like pip or condo for python. 
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): A Javascript compiler that transpiles modern JS to a browser compatible version. 
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A linter to keep your code standardized. 

**Technologies we aren’t using yet:** 
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): A code bundler. This allows you to create one bundled file from all your javascript and css files. We don’t have a need for this yet, and not using it demonstrates more clearly why it is helpful.
